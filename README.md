# This is my web 3D assignment
# Primarily built with a mac I used maya for the creation of my models then converted them to x3d format using an online third party converter given i had the prerequisite the obj file.
# I tried moving the textures to the assets folder but the models always gave an error when i moved them so they stayed on the main tree
